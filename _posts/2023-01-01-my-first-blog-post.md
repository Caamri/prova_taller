This is a paragraph in my first post.
Show off your Markdown!

## Heading Two 

Any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.
Leave an blank line between headings and paragraphs.
Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**. I can also do italics  _with underscores_ and __bold__ with double underscores

**I have bold text and *these words are in italics* so they are**

Code can be highlighted with `backticks`.

```
this is code block

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four
